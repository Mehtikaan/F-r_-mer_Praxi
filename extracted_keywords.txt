Okay, let's tackle this. The user provided a long text about an electrochemical oxygen sensor and then a list of 20 claims. They want keywords related to the content. First, I need to understand the main points of the text.

The text describes an electrochemical oxygen sensor with components like a positive electrode, negative electrode, electrolyte solution, separation membrane, and a resistance element. It mentions specific parameters like current values, resistance, and conditions for the electrolyte solution, such as using a chelating agent like citric acid. There are also claims that specify details like the separation membrane's thickness, materials, and ratios involving the electrolyte volume and tin content.

Now, to extract keywords. The main components are the electrodes, electrolyte solution, separation membrane, and resistance element. The electrolyte solution's properties include chelating agents, citric acid, and specific concentrations. There are also technical parameters like current thresholds (7-10 microA), resistance values (1050-1500 ohms), humidity and temperature conditions (50% RH, 25°C), and the separation membrane's material (fluorocarbon resin) and thickness (8 micrometers). The claims mention ratios like x/y ≥ 0.3 (ml/g) involving electrolyte volume and tin content.

I should list these components, materials, parameters, and specific terms. Make sure to include all the technical terms and specifications mentioned. Avoid any extra explanations, just the keywords. Let me check if I missed anything. The user wants keywords, so terms like "electrochemical oxygen sensor," "positive electrode," "negative electrode," "electrolyte solution," "separation membrane," "resistance element," "chelating agent," "citric acid," "fluorocarbon resin," "current value," "resistance value," "relative humidity," "temperature," "tin content," "volume-to-weight ratio," etc., should be included. Also, the specific numbers like 7 microA, 1050 ohms, 50% RH, 25°C, 8 micrometers. Need to ensure all these are covered without any markdown.
